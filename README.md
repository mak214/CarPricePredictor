# Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

This project predicts the price of a used car based on its features using a **Linear Regression** model.

## 📚 Project Description

- Used the `quikr_car.csv` dataset collected from Quikr (online marketplace).
- Performed **extensive cleaning** to prepare the dataset:
  - Removed invalid year entries and non-numeric kms driven.
  - Handled missing values in fuel type.
  - Filtered out entries with unrealistic prices (>60 lakh).
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict car prices.
